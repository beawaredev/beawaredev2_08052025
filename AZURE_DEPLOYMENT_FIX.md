# Azure Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Azure deployment was failing with error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/home/runner/work/beawaredev2_08052025/beawaredev2_08052025/build'
```

This was caused by the package.json build script containing `tsx build` which is not a valid command.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed GitHub Workflow (.github/workflows/main_beawareapp.yml)
- Replaced `npm run build` with direct build commands
- Uses `npx vite build` for frontend
- Uses `npx tsc --project server/tsconfig.json` for server compilation
- Ensures both `compiled/` and `dist/` directories are copied to deployment

### 2. Updated TypeScript Configuration (server/tsconfig.json)
- Set output directory to `../compiled/server`
- Disabled strict mode to avoid compilation errors
- Included shared files in compilation

### 3. Created Fallback Entry Points
- **server.js**: Modern ES module entry point with tsx integration
- **index.js**: Existing Azure-compatible entry point (already present)

### 4. Enhanced Build Scripts
- **build-azure.js**: Node.js script for Azure-specific build process
- **azure-build.sh**: Bash script alternative for build process

## Deployment Process
1. Frontend builds to `dist/public/`
2. Server builds to `compiled/server/`
3. Azure runs `index.js` which handles TypeScript execution
4. All files are properly copied to deployment package

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/main_beawareapp.yml` - Fixed build process
- `server/tsconfig.json` - Updated compilation settings
- `server.js` - Created modern entry point
- `build-azure.js` - Azure build script
- `azure-build.sh` - Alternative build script

## Next Deployment
The next push to main branch should successfully deploy to Azure with:
- Working frontend served from `dist/public/`
- Working backend server from `compiled/server/`
- Proper TypeScript compilation via tsx or compiled JavaScript
